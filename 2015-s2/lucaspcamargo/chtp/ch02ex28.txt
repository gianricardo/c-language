A fatal error is an event of catastrophic program failure, that usually results 
in the operating system intervention and termination of the program, because it 
can't continue on it's own.

A non-fatal error is usually a logical error, or an error that the program 
captures and treats, even if it means the program can do it's intended task. 

But it implies the program continues execution. Therefore, nonfatal errors are 
preferable, and well-written and well-behaved programs tend to handle errors 
somewhat gracefully.
